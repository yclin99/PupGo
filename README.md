## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
You can discover dogs around you and follow them for future notifications. Also create a walking event that you are going to hold. Then, you can decide to walk with the other dogs, or not ;-)

This projects includes four main UI (Match, Explore, Notification and Setting, and we have arranged them with their supportings into four subfolders under <b>View<b>.

The files for model are under folder <b>Utilities<b>.

The code for query and mutation (that is to post and get data from mySQL) is in folder <b>GraphQL<b>.

You may find what you need from the above instructions.
